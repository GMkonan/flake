Based initially on Titus quickshell config!

All this code will probably go to my flake when I feel comfortable with it

## Running
As long as you have quickshell installed just run qs. Quickshell auto-reload on changes making it pretty easy to develop.

## MVP
- [x] add date module

- [x] catppuccin theme / support for theme changing

## Todo

    - maybe check how other things like macos do it. maybe show percentage only
    in certain parts and show colors for each stage?
